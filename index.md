Welcome to my Blog! 

My name is Brandon and I'm an aspiring IT professional. I have already completed my CCNA and I am on the cusp of obtaining my Solutions Architect Associate certification for AWS.

This blog is supposed to be for the documentation of my projects and trials I go through completing them.
